# Introduction

Welcome to **ReactiveStore** that allows effective state management in a simple way for JS applications.

## What does ReactiveStore?

It is a package for state management, based on the **Flux** architecture, in which the data flow is unidirectional. The data is received from the view through actions and through observers it will update the view again, this is achieved by implementing reactivity, which we rely on **RxJS**.

**ReactiveStore** applies its processes in a simple way. It saves you the hassle of creating repetitive code and so the learning curve is not very steep, allowing for easy implementation for both experienced and inexperienced developers.
